<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi & welcome to my first webpage.</h2>
<p>I am Kathrin and I am living in Augsburg, Germany. I have been working in the IT industry now for about 3 years 
  and collected some professional experience in different sectors before that.
</p>

<p>In IT you would call my background as being a classic "carreer changer". And this is true with all its benefits and drawbacks that come along with it.
  You are interested what those two sides of the coin look exactly?
  Well then enjoy this webpage and get a deeper insight of how I experienced this journey so far. I can promise: It's worth it! </p>

<p>Coming back to the introduction... I am quite a multifold interested person (is this how you would call it?). Well, I like to read about politics, life and health topics. 
  I also identified that I am quite passionate using some energy and time to support less privileged people. I can't stand how unfair the world is sometimes 
  and I use small opportunities to make the world a tiny little better at times.
  Besides that I love practicing yoga, being outdoors in the sun, doing handcrafted things at home, having deep conversations about experiences, life & travels with friends and strangers,
  speaking & hearing other languages, trying out different food & tastes and in general being surrounded by honest and grounded people. </p>
